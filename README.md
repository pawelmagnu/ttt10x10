An upgraded version of my 3x3 ttt game: https://github.com/pawelmagnu/ttt3x3

The game takes place on a 10x10 grid

First to 5 marks in any direction wins

The player takes turns alternating with an AI algorithm (a simple min-max tree)

During the testing process the game resulted in a draw/win for the AI 87% of the time

Unfortunately there exists a winning strategy for the human player :c
